# Challenge-1-Refactoring

## Description

This is the first assignment for the bootcamp. The challenges I completed for this assignment are:

- Changed non-semantic elements into semantic elements to define the content of the webpage properly
- Added accessible alt attributes to images and icons
- Ensured the elements in the document follow a logical structure and the title is concise and descriptive
- Ensured that the heading attributes are in a sequential order
- Ensured that the application deploys properly at live URL

## Credits

Most of the code was provided by the bootcamp. My task was to refactor aspects to improve the application.
